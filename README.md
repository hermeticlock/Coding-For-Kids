# Coding-For-Kids
Codingforkids.us website
This is the coding for kids website. Currently hosted at http://codingforkids.us/
## What's it about?
Codingforkids was the website I used to teach fourth and fifth graders basic web development skills like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Approximately 70 students went through the program at seven different Elementary Schools around the local area.
## What's happening with it?
Codingforkids is slowly transitioning into a private lessons hub for students all around the world that are interested in coding.
